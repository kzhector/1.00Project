# 1.00Project
The purpose of this project is to explore the impact of Wildfires on Biodiversity. And visualize the data using folium webamps.
All of the coding except for launching on Flask was done in Google Colab, and the necessary Libraries are already installed and imported there. 
For launching the server, I used Flask on my local device, so you will have to install flask. A pip install flask comand in the terminal should suffice
While you do not need the datasets to launch the maps on the server, and since all of the datasets are so large, I would recommend dowloading them yourself and putting them in google drive, then linking to the appropriate path in your drive
